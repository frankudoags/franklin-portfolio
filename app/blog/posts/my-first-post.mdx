# Welcome to My New Portfolio!

Hello world! This is the inaugural post on my new portfolio blog. I'm excited to share my journey as a software engineer with you.

## A Fresh Start

I've just launched this new portfolio built on the excellent **[https://laurentcodes.xyz](https://laurentcodes.xyz)** open source site by **[Laurent](https://github.com/laurentcodes)**. His minimalist design approach and clean code structure provided the perfect foundation for showcasing my work in development, engineering, and open source contributions.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will serve as a space for me to share:

- **Technical Insights**: Deep dives into frontend engineering, backend architecture, and performance optimization
- **Blockchain & Security**: My experiences with Ethereum development, smart contract security, and Web3 technologies  
- **Open Source Journey**: Stories from contributing to projects like Reth, Alloy, and Viem
- **Career Reflections**: Lessons learned from building products at Oyster, Konga, and Afrihealth
- **Engineering Best Practices**: Thoughts on code quality, testing, and scalable architecture

## About My Work

As a Product Engineer at **Oyster Skin Technologies** and former Frontend Engineer at **Konga**, I've had the privilege of working on diverse challenges:

- Building scalable search platforms handling millions of records
- Developing mobile applications with 1000+ downloads at launch
- Contributing to core Ethereum infrastructure used by thousands of developers
- Leading frontend architecture and engineering best practices

## Let's Connect!

I'm passionate about building innovative solutions and mentoring other developers. Whether you're interested in:

- Frontend/Fullstack opportunities
- Open source collaboration  
- Technical discussions
- Or just want to chat about technology

Feel free to reach out through my [contact page](/contact) or connect on [GitHub](https://github.com/frankudoags).

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to sharing more technical content with you all!
